# Form Validation Project

This project is a class assignment designed to demonstrate form validation using JavaScript. It involves creating a form in HTML and applying validation rules using JavaScript to ensure that the user inputs are correct and in the required format. 

The main goal of this project is to understand and implement client-side validation, which is crucial for any web application to ensure data integrity and improve user experience.

## Features

- Client-side form validation using JavaScript
- Custom validation messages for different input errors
- Interactive user interface

## How to Run

Open the `index.html` file in any web browser to see the form and its validation in action.

## Future Improvements

- Implement server-side validation
- Add more complex validation rules
- Improve the user interface design
